I built a fully functional eLearning platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, 
and Node.js with PostgreSQL for the backend. The website allows users to sign up, log in, watch video lessons,
take quizzes, and track their progress. 
It features a responsive design, secure authentication, and seamless interaction between the frontend and backend using RESTful APIs
